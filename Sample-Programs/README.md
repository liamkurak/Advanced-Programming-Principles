# Sample Programs

Here you will find the sample programs we write and use in class.

The best way to access these is to `git pull` them down to your local copy of the public repository.

To view them online, use the [code repository view of this directory](https://github.umn.edu/umn-csci-2041-1-S22/public-class-repo/tree/master/Course-Resources/Sample-Programs).
